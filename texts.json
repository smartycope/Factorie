        "weight":"How much do you care about this factor? For instance, we probably don\"t care much about how many leftovers it has, but we probably care a more about what it tastes like. If you\"re unsure, we can tweak this later as well.",
        "scale":"What are the bounds of this factor? For instance, if it\"s on a scale of 0-10, then we probably want it to be between 0 and 10. If it\"s not clear, however, you can select \"Unbounded\" to automatically calculate it from the answers you give. There may also be one but not the other, for example, for the \"cost\" factor, we know it\"s not negative (no one is going to pay a *us* for a meal), but it could cost as much as we want. However, if you know you\"re not going to spend more than $100, you can set the max to 100. Adding a scale explicitly is going to be more accurate than not.",
        "unit": "This is to help you keep track of what the scale is. You can have the scale be anything you want, 0-10, dollars, miles, etc. For vauge factors, for example Taste, it\"s probably easiest to use a 0-10 scale.",

Because getting\nthe weights right can have a large impact on the final answer, I've created a\nseperate way to break it down as well. Remember, this is targeted towards making\nbig decisions that might have lots of factors.\n\nIf you think the weights you added when adding factors are already pretty accurate,\nyou can skip this step.\n\nThere's steps to fine tuning the factors. You can do either one, both, or neither\nof them as you'd like. First, you can go through the section that helps you sort\nthe factors in order of importance. It breaks it down into pairs of factors\nand asks which is more important. It uses a custom algorithm to make the sorting\nas efficient as possible. It won't change any of the weights until you're done\nsorting them, and then it will ask you if you want to set them as the new weights.\n\nFrom there, you can go to the slider, which shows the weights next to each other.\nYou can adjust the weights by dragging the sliders, so they're not simply evenly\nspaced. I've also included several graphs to help you visualize the weights.\n\nOnce you're done here, head over to the `Answers` page to start making the\ndecision."
